# AI/ML Architectural Considerations

When planning an AI/ML architecture, there's a number of decisions a business needs to make depending on goals and key metrics that customers require. These planning considerations are important, because they can help designing scalable and efficient AI/ML solutions that provide accurate results, perform well under load, and optimize costs and operations for any architectural changes that may be needed. Look at this table of key decisions and try to identify metrics important for your business:

Metric | Description
------------ | -------------
Getting started with AI | Interested in exploration of AI/ML methods
Optimize model accuracy | Optimizing, starting with pre-trained, packaged or full custom models
Optimize costs and operations | Architectural optimization of existing AI/ML operations
Increase scale and performance | Scale/performance may depend on many factors, for example a number of users or geographic availability
Compliance and governance | Making AI/ML model comply with government or corporate policies

Overall these metrics and decisions for AI/ML roll into an overall architecture including data strategy, personalization, operationalization and automation.

## Getting Started with AI

Your business may be just beginning with AI, many customers are looking into ways to integrate AI/ML solutions. Typically this exploration begins with inference and pre-built services and models like Azure Cognitive Services, providing a convenient and easy interface and a collection of tested and pre-trained models.
