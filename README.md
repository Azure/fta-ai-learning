## Getting Started 

## Classification

- [Image Classification](https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes/tree/master/scenarios/classification) 

## Detection

Object detection is a technique that allows you to detect the an object within an image (usually by specifying a bounding box).

- [Detect objects in images](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-object-detection)
- [Brand detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-brand-detection)

## Segmentation

- **Segmentation** - image classification is a machine learning technique to learn and predict the category of a given image. [Segmentation](https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes/tree/master/scenarios/segmentation)
