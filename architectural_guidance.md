# AI/ML Architectural Guidance

When planning an AI/ML architecture, there's a number of decisions a business needs to make depending on goals and key metrics that a solution requires. These planning considerations are important, because they can help designing scaleable AI/ML solutions that perform well under load, provide accurate results, and optimize costs and operations for any architectural changes that may be needed. 

Metric | Description
------------ | -------------
Getting started with AI | Interested in exploration of AI/ML methods
Optimize model accuracy | Optimizing, starting with pre-trained, packaged or full custom models
Optimize costs and operations | Architectural optimization of existing AI/ML operations
Increase scale and performance | Scale/performance may depend on many factors, for example a number of users or geographic availability
Compliance and governance | Making AI/ML model comply with government or corporate policies
